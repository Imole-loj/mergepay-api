/**
 * Structured audit logging middleware — issue #914.
 *
 * A route-level `onResponse` hook factory that gives a state-changing
 * endpoint an audit record without its handler having to write one itself.
 * Handlers that already write a richer, in-transaction row (`auditTx` /
 * `logActionTx` / `auditGroupMemberActionTx`) keep doing so — that row commits
 * with the mutation and can never survive a rollback. This middleware is the
 * declarative path for the endpoints where no such transaction exists and
 * "the request succeeded" *is* the state change (a profile update, a queued
 * webhook test delivery).
 *
 * Why `onResponse`, and why that satisfies the issue's requirements:
 *
 *  - **Zero latency cost.** The hook runs only after the reply has been sent,
 *    so the audit write is physically unable to add to request duration. The
 *    write is scheduled through {@link logAuditTrail} and never awaited.
 *  - **Only real state changes are recorded.** Non-state-changing methods
 *    (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) and any reply outside 2xx are skipped: a rejected call
 *    changed nothing, and a trail that says otherwise is worse than no trail.
 *  - **Request context without secrets.** The actor comes from `req.user`,
 *    the target from the route's own params, and the metadata is the matched
 *    route *pattern* plus whatever field **names** a caller opts into. Headers,
 *    tokens, bodies, and XDRs are never read here, and everything that does
 *    reach the row still passes through `sanitizeAuditMetadata`
 *    (src/lib/audit-logger.ts) on the way out.
 *
 * Failures never surface: the hook swallows its own errors (the response is
 * already delivered by the time it runs), and the write itself is best-effort.
