/**
 * Group membership and admin permission middleware guards for restricted routes (#549, #808).
 *
 * Implements reusable Fastify preHandler middleware guards to enforce group
 * membership and admin privileges consistently across group management, treasury,
 * and expense mutation endpoints.
 *
 * Guards inspect request parameters (e.g. `id` or `groupId`) and authenticated user context
 * to verify database membership and roles:
 *   - requireGroupMember / requireMembershipGuard: ensures the caller is at least a member (or admin).
 *   - requireGroupAdmin / requireAdminGuard: ensures the caller holds the admin role.
 *   - requireExpensePayerOrAdmin / requireExpenseMutationRole: ensures the caller is either
 *     the creator/payer of the expense or an administrator of the owning group.
 *
 * Both accept `active: true`, which additionally rejects an archived group
 * (issue #648). Mutating group management routes set it; reads, leaving, and
 * archiving itself deliberately do not, so an archived group's history stays
 * readable and a member who no longer has an active role can still exit.
 *
 * Authorization failures return:
 *   - 401 Unauthorized when unauthenticated
 *   - 403 Forbidden when caller is not a member or lacks required privileges
 *   - 404 Not Found when the target group or expense does not exist
